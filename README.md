## Rad Creature Party

Rad Creature Party is a collective art project made by a group of friends at a birthday party at a Ramen shop in Oakland, California.

If you want to host your own Rad Creature Party, get your friends together over your favorite drink or snack, Give your friends colorful markers, and three slips of paper, with notches on each slip of paper corresponding where the head, body, and legs start and end. You can make the slips of paper all the same height, or alternate their heights. On the first slip of paper, draw the creature’s head. On the second slip of paper, draw the creature’s body. On the third slip of paper, draw the creature’s legs. The can match, but they don’t have to! When everyone is finished drawing, marvel at each others rad creatures, and then combine your creatures to make brand new rad creatures! Have fun and be sure to compliment your friends on their awesome drawing skills.

This art project was created by Anastasia Tumanova while she was running late to her own birthday party. This website was built by her pal, John Furrow.
